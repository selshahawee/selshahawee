### 🛑 Mission Briefing  
- **Identity**: Undercover React operative posing as a mild-mannered coder… but secretly Googling “how to center a div” at 3 AM.  
- **Special Abilities**:
  - I write code that sometimes works… on the second try.so good it makes senior devs 
     cry.  
  - Styling with Tailwind so sharp it cuts through bugs.  
  - Next.js so fast, it time travels.  

- **Life Motto**: "Commit, push, pray."

### ⚔️ Agent’s Arsenal (Tech Stack)
- **React infiltration** – Stealthily building components before you even know they’re 
   there.
- **Next.js espionage** – Sneaking in SEO friendly pages faster than a spy in a 
   tuxedo.  
- **JavaScript** – The weapon of choice. Warning: may explode on impact.  
- **TypeScript** – Because strong typing saves lines.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – For when you need your styles to fly.  
- **Bootstrap** – For when I need something that “just works”… but feels like wearing flip-flops to a wedding.
- **Ant Design** – Because spies need beautiful disguises.
